# FFTPracticeCS
Practicing C# with Fourier Transforms

What better way to practice C# than to make a simple FFT bit of code which detects the note C#?

Because this is a learning experience I have not used any third-party libraries for the WAV file or FFT implementation but instead done it by hand. Pardon the wheel-reinvention, but it was a useful experience.
